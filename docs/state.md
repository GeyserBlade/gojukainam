# Current state — read first, update before you hand off

This file is the handoff between coding agents. It describes what is in flight
right now, not the permanent architecture (that's
[`architecture.md`](architecture.md)).

**Last updated:** 2026-08-01 — by Claude Code: shared agent docs, 18 type-error
fixes, merge of 10 upstream PRs, local Postgres + seed repair, the athlete-pool
endpoint, and the Entry Management redesign port.

## Branch

`main`. Pushing to `main` deploys to Railway, so it is a release, not a save.

**Local `main` is ahead of `origin/main` by several commits that have not been
pushed** — the pool endpoint and the redesign port among them. Verified locally
against a database, but never run against production data.

## In flight (uncommitted)

Nothing. The Entry Management redesign that used to sit here is committed and
live — see "Entry Management redesign" below.

Still carried as known gaps of that screen (from its README at the repo root):

- Team entries (`TEAM_KATA` / `TEAM_KUMITE`) are *displayed* but not creatable
  here — team enrolment wants its own flow.
- Weight classes are not auto-assigned on individual kumite creates.
- The athlete pool renders every athlete for admins on "All clubs"; virtualise
  the list if the dataset grows into the thousands.

## Verification (run 2026-08-01, TypeScript 6.0.3)

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `backend`: `npx tsc --noEmit` | **clean**, exit 0 |
| `backend`: `npm run build` | **succeeds**, exit 0 |
| `frontend`: `npx tsc --noEmit` | **clean**, exit 0 |
| `frontend`: `npm run build` | **succeeds**, exit 0 (Vite/esbuild does not type-check) |
| Frontend boots, `/signin` renders, console clean | **yes** (dev server on 5180) |
| Any screen exercised against a live API | **no** — see below |

**Superseded 2026-08-01 — a local database now exists**, see "Local development
database" below. At the time of the type-fix work the only `DATABASE_URL` was
the Railway production instance, so nothing was run against a database; the app
has since been verified end to end locally.

## Type errors fixed (2026-08-01)

The frontend previously had 18 type errors, all in files the entry-management
redesign does not touch. All are now fixed; the checks above run clean with no
flags. What changed, and why it matters beyond the type-check:

- **`src/lib/entries.ts`** — deleted the duplicate `Division` / `WeightClass`
  interfaces and re-exported the canonical ones from `lib/events`. The entries
  API returns the full division row (`division: true` in `entry.service.ts`), so
  the narrow local copy was simply missing `eventId` and made the two types
  mutually unassignable. Nothing imported them from `lib/entries`, so this was
  contained.
- **`src/pages/Events.tsx`, `src/pages/EntriesView.tsx`** — `queryFn: listEvents`
  passed `listEvents` (signature `(activeOnly = false)`) straight to TanStack
  Query, which called it with the query *context object*. Being truthy, that
  object meant **every caller was silently fetching `activeOnly=true`**, i.e.
  DRAFT + ACTIVE only. On the event admin page that was a live bug: CLOSED and
  ARCHIVED events were invisible even though the page renders status badges for
  them. Now `Events.tsx` calls `listEvents()` (all events) and `EntriesView.tsx`
  calls `listEvents(true)` (unchanged behaviour, explicit).
- **Query keys split as a consequence.** Those two pages now return different
  result sets, so they can no longer share the key `["events"]`:
  `Events.tsx` uses `["events", "all"]`, `EntriesView.tsx` uses
  `["events", "active"]` (matching what `EventManagement.tsx` already did).
  Existing `invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["events"] })` calls still match both
  by prefix. **`Dashboard.tsx` still uses the bare `["events"]` key** with its
  own inline `api.get("/events")` — harmless (its own cache entry, still
  invalidated by prefix), but it's the last one out of step.
- **`src/pages/AthleteForm.tsx`** — the submit payload was typed
  `Partial<Athlete> & { weightKg?: number }`, which conflicts with the API's
  `number | null`. Dropped the intersection and removed a dead
  `typeof weightKg === "string"` branch: the weight input already coerces with
  `Number(...) || undefined` on change, so no string ever reaches submit.
- **`src/vite-env.d.ts`** — added `declare module "@fontsource-variable/inter"`.
  The package ships CSS with no typings and TS 6 (TS2882) requires a declaration
  even for a side-effect import.
- **`frontend/tsconfig.json`** — removed the deprecated `baseUrl` (TS 6 reports
  it as TS5101 and **aborts the whole type-check before reading a single
  file** — which is why these 18 errors could sit unnoticed) and rewrote the
  path mapping as `"@/*": ["./src/*"]`, which TS requires once `baseUrl` is
  gone. `npx tsc --noEmit` now works with no flags.

Behavioural changes to sanity-check when someone next runs the app against real
data: the event admin list should now include CLOSED and ARCHIVED events.

## Entry Management redesign — ported and live (2026-08-01)

The redesign (athlete pool + all division boards at once + bulk enrol +
live eligibility ghosting) has **replaced** the old one-division-at-a-time
screen at `/hub/entries`. All three steps are done:

1. ✅ **Event-wide athlete pool endpoint** — `GET /api/events/:id/athlete-pool`.
   The redesign originally fetched `listAllAthletes()` / `listAthletes()` and
   computed eligibility client-side, which was wrong twice over: `/athletes/all`
   is SUPERADMIN-only so the ADMIN path 403'd, and those endpoints return full
   athlete rows including `idNumber`, `medicalNotes`, and guardian contacts —
   re-opening the exposure that commit `0276ffb` closed on the eligibility
   endpoint. The new endpoint returns the same narrow projection as
   `getEligibleAthletes` (no PII), forces non-admin roles to their own club, and
   answers the whole event in one request instead of one per division (32 in the
   seeded event). Client: `getAthletePool()` / `PoolAthlete` in `lib/events.ts`.
2. ✅ **Rewired to the hub** — dropped its own `AppShell` and event picker
   (`EventHubLayout` owns both), reads the event from `useSelectedEvent()`, and
   fetches via `getAthletePool`. Two queries disappeared: `listEvents` is the
   hub's, and `getEvent` was unnecessary because `/events` already returns
   `configJson`. `EnrichedAthlete` is now just `PoolAthlete` — the server
   resolves age, so the client-side enrichment pass is gone, and `isEligible`
   takes a structural `{dob, gender}` so nothing in this screen depends on the
   PII-carrying `Athlete` type.
3. ✅ **Guards ported** — `registrationState`/`addBlocked` now gates all four
   mutation paths (single add, drag-drop, bulk add, submit-all-drafts), shows
   the closed-registration banner, and disables the submit button, the bulk
   action bar and the per-athlete division toggles. `entry.statusReason` renders
   on RETURNED entries in `DivisionBoard`.

**A note for whoever touches this next:** the guard belongs on *every* create
path, not just the visible button. The bulk bar creates many entries per click,
and drag-drop bypasses the row controls entirely — both are gated at the handler
as well as in the UI.

### Verification (against the local database, in the browser)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Pool response contains no PII field | ✅ id, clubId, firstName, lastName, dob, gender, nationality, weightKg, age, club, belt, isEntered |
| CLUB_MANAGER passing another club's `?clubId=` | ✅ forced to own club, param ignored |
| ADMIN filtering by `?clubId=` | ✅ works (intended admin capability) |
| Unauthenticated / unknown event | ✅ 401 / 404 |
| Requests to render the screen | ✅ 1 pool call, not 32 per-division calls; no `/athletes/all` |
| Screen renders in hub with no duplicate chrome | ✅ |
| Eligibility ghosting + bulk counts | ✅ selecting an already-entered 14yo gave `KATA +0 · KUMITE +0` |
| CLUB_MANAGER on a closed event | ✅ banner shown, submit disabled, division toggles `disabled` with "Registration is closed" |
| ADMIN on the same closed event | ✅ no banner, controls enabled (admins bypass) |
| Club scoping visible in UI | ✅ club manager sees 2 athletes, admin sees 28 |
| Creating an entry through the new path | ✅ 20→21 entries; stats, pool count and board all updated |
| Draw-engine suite after the service change | ✅ still passes |

Not exercised: actual pointer drag-and-drop (the handler is shared with the
click path, which is covered) and team entries, which this screen still does not
create — see the redesign README at the repo root.

## Local development database (set up 2026-08-01)

Postgres 16.13 via Homebrew, already running on 5432. Role `gojukainam`,
database `karate`. `backend/.env` `DATABASE_URL` now points there; the Railway
production URL is preserved on a commented `# PROD_DATABASE_URL=` line in the
same file. Other databases on that server (`cctv_alerts`, `ryansrecipes`) belong
to unrelated projects.

Verified working end to end: migrations applied (`migrate deploy`, 24
migrations), `migrate diff` reports no drift between schema and migration
history, seed populates, backend serves on 4000, frontend on 5173, login
succeeds, and the entries hub renders real seeded data. The draw-engine suite
(`ALLOW_DEV_AUTH=true npx tsx scripts/test-draws.ts`) — the same one CI runs and
the only real tests in the repo — **passes locally**, which was impossible
before.

Local login: `dev@localhost.test` / `devpassword123` (SUPERADMIN, local only).

### Two seed bugs fixed to get here

`npm run prisma:seed` had been broken for a long time — CI never runs the seed,
so nothing caught it:

1. **Wrong config path.** It read `config/event-config.yaml` relative to the
   working directory, but npm scripts run with cwd `backend/` while the config
   lives at the repo root, so the documented command always threw ENOENT. Now
   resolved relative to the script file via `import.meta.url`.
2. **Stale against the schema.** It set `Athlete.beltRank` and
   `emergencyName`/`emergencyPhone` (all removed), omitted the now-required
   `Division.category`, and referenced `Gender.Open` which no longer exists. It
   also never seeded any `Belt` rows even though `Athlete.beltId` is a required
   FK — and the docs claimed it seeded belts.

The rewritten seed creates 8 belts, 1 event, 32 divisions (age band × gender ×
category), 6 clubs, 10 athletes spread across clubs and age bands, and 20
entries. It guards against double-seeding rather than duplicating data, and
leaves the SUPERADMIN to `npm run create-superuser` (which needs a password
hash).

### Port alignment

`frontend/.env.development.local` pointed `VITE_API_BASE` at 4000 → **4001**
mismatch with `backend/.env` (`PORT=4000`) and the tracked `launch.json`. Set to
4000 to match both. If another project needs 4000 (ryansrecipes has used it),
change the backend `PORT` and this file together. Previous value backed up in
the session scratchpad.

## Other untracked, non-code files

`.agents/`, `.claude/` (agent config: `launch.json` dev-server entry on port
5180, local permissions), `skills-lock.json`. Local tooling, not app code.

## Open items / follow-ups

- Root `README.md` is a UTF-16 stub with no real content.
- `filestructure.txt` is a stale 3.6 MB generated dump; it should probably be
  deleted or gitignored rather than maintained.
- `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` still sends `x-role` / `x-club-id` dev headers from
  `localStorage`; the backend only honours them when `ALLOW_DEV_AUTH=true`.
  Removing this path once real auth is fully trusted would tighten things up.
- No test suite exists. `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npm run build` is the only gate.

## How to update this file

When you finish a session, rewrite the sections above so the next agent (or the
next model) starts where you stopped:

- move anything you committed out of "In flight"
- record what you actually verified, in those words — not "should work"
- add anything you discovered that isn't obvious from the code
